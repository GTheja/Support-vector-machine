# Support-vector-machine
This project is based on support vector machine. SVM are supervised learning models. In my i use the recipes to predict whether its cupcake or muffin. 
In this project I mainly use numpy for linaer analyis and pandas for importing data , sklearn(machine learning package which contains features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.) and for plots i used matplotlib and seaborn and pickle
